# Release Management and Approval Gates for Pomodux

> **Note:** This document defines the structured release-based development approach with approval gates, TDD integration, and quality assurance processes.

## 1.0 Release Management Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Release-Based Development**: Each release has clearly defined, agreed-upon functionality
- **Approval Gates**: Quality checkpoints requiring explicit approval before proceeding
- **TDD Integration**: All features follow Test-Driven Development process
- **Documentation-Driven**: Progress tracked and documented throughout development
- **User Testing**: Regular user testing and feedback integration

### 1.2 Release Structure

```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Approval Gate 2: Development Completion
â”œâ”€â”€ Testing Phase
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ User Testing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Bug Fixes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Approval Gate 3: User Acceptance
â””â”€â”€ Release Phase
    â”œâ”€â”€ Final Documentation
    â”œâ”€â”€ Rebuild Binary: Rebuild the CLI binary for all target platforms before packaging or distribution (e.g., run `make build`)
