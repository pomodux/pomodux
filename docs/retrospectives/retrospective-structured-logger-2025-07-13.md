## 1. Brainstorm Lessons Learned

### Technical Implementation Lessons

#### Successes
- **Architecture Decision**: Using logrus as the logging library was the right choice - mature, well-maintained, and feature-rich
- **Default Configuration**: Setting logger to default to file output preserved terminal UX while providing comprehensive logging
- **Path Expansion**: Adding `~` expansion for log file paths improved user experience and configuration flexibility
- **Directory Creation**: Automatic creation of log directories prevented startup errors and improved robustness
- **Event Logging**: Complete coverage of timer lifecycle events (start, pause, resume, stop, complete) provides excellent observability

#### Technical Challenges
- **Path Expansion Issue**: Initial implementation didn't handle `~` in config paths, requiring code fix
- **Directory Creation**: Missing automatic directory creation caused initial user confusion
- **Default Output**: Had to change default from console to file to preserve terminal UX
