# Retrospective - Release 0.3.0

## User Retrospective Feedback - Release 0.3.0

### Positive Experiences
- CLI enhancements (status, history, config) improved usability and scriptability
- Plugin system foundation validated with Lua and event-driven hooks
- Proof-of-concept approach enabled rapid iteration and early feedback
- Documentation and technical specs kept up to date throughout the release

### Areas for Improvement
- Some configuration and timer output edge cases not caught until UAT
- Automated test failures in configuration and persistent timer commands
- Need for more robust duration parsing and output consistency
- JSON and text output for config/history could be more consistent

### Process Observations
- TDD and proof-of-concept validation worked well for major features
- Automated and manual tests both essential for CLI and plugin system
- Documentation updates lagged slightly behind code changes at times
- Approval gates and documentation-driven process provided clear structure

### Technical Insights
- Lua-based plugin system is viable and performant for Pomodux
- Asynchronous event dispatch prevents plugin performance bottlenecks
- CLI enhancements are easily testable and maintainable
- Configuration management benefits from strict validation and templates

### Recommendations
- Improve test coverage for configuration and timer output edge cases
- Refactor config and timer output for consistency (text/JSON)
- Add more robust duration parsing and error messages
- Continue to prioritize documentation updates alongside code changes
- Consider adding integration tests for plugin system and CLI together
