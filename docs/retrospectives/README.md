# Retrospectives Directory

This directory contains retrospective analysis documents for completed releases. Each retrospective captures lessons learned, documentation audits, and improvement recommendations.

## Purpose

Retrospectives are conducted after the completion or failure of a release to:
- Capture lessons learned from the release experience
- Audit documentation and cursor rules for accuracy and effectiveness
- Identify areas for process improvement
- Ensure continuous improvement of the development workflow

## File Naming Convention

Retrospective documents follow the naming convention:
```
retrospective-release-X.Y.Z.md
```

Examples:
- `retrospective-release-0.1.0.md`
- `retrospective-release-0.2.0.md`
- `retrospective-release-0.2.1.md`

## Retrospective Process

The retrospective process is defined in the `.cursorrules` file and includes:

1. **Brainstorm Lessons Learned**: Comprehensive review of the release experience
2. **Capture User Feedback**: Direct insights from the user's perspective
3. **Complete Documentation Audit**: Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
4. **Complete Cursor Rules Audit**: Assess effectiveness of current cursor rules
5. **Suggest Updates and Improvements**: Propose specific changes based on findings

## Integration with Release Management

Retrospectives are integrated with the release management process:
- Findings inform future release planning
- Process improvements are incorporated into approval gates
- Documentation standards are updated based on audit results
- Cursor rules are refined to support improved processes

## Historical Record

This directory serves as a historical record of project evolution and continuous improvement efforts. Each retrospective provides valuable context for understanding how the project has evolved and what lessons have been learned over time.
