## User Retrospective Feedback - Release 0.4.2

### Positive Experiences
- Migration to the new organization repository was straightforward.
- Automated search and replace for import paths minimized manual errors.
- Documentation and release process templates were helpful for tracking changes.

### Areas for Improvement
- Some linter errors surfaced due to Go module path mismatches after migration.
- Need for a checklist for Go module path updates and `go.mod`/`go.sum` validation.

### Process Observations
- The release was non-functional (no user-facing features), but required careful coordination to avoid breaking builds.
- The release process for non-feature changes could be streamlined.

### Technical Insights
- Go import path changes require careful attention to module paths and dependency management.
- Automated tools can help, but manual review is still necessary.

### Recommendations
- Add a migration checklist to the documentation for future repository moves.
- Include a CI check for module path consistency after migration.
