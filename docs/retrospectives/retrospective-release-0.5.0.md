# Retrospective - Release 0.5.0

## Lessons Learned Summary

- Attempted implementation of Bubbletea-based TUI revealed significant technical complexity, especially around cross-process synchronization.
- Partial TUI code exists in `internal/tui/`, but is not production-ready or enabled for end users.
- Planning, design, and documentation work were thorough and will inform future releases.
- Early technical prototyping is critical for features with architectural risk.
- Backlog and ADR processes are effective for tracking and documenting decisions.

## User Retrospective Feedback - Release 0.5.0

### Positive Experiences
- Clear planning and documentation for the TUI feature.
- Strong alignment between backlog, ADRs, and technical specifications.

### Areas for Improvement
- Need for earlier technical prototyping to identify blockers.
- Automated TUI testing coverage is lacking and must be prioritized.
- Communication of feature status (partial implementation) could be clearer in release notes.

### Process Observations
- The 4-gate approval process and ADR audits are effective for managing architectural risk.
- Backlog management is clear and up to date.

### Technical Insights
- Cross-process synchronization for TUI/CLI is a major technical challenge.
- Bubbletea and Lipgloss are appropriate choices for TUI development.
- Partial implementation can be valuable for future work, but must be clearly documented.

### Recommendations
- Prioritize technical prototyping for high-risk features.
- Ensure all new TUI code is covered by automated tests (teatest, golden files).
- Clearly document the status of partially implemented features in release notes and backlog.
- Continue to use ADRs and retrospectives to guide architectural decisions.

## Documentation Audit Report

- All core documentation (requirements, technical specs, go standards, release management) is current and accurate.
- Backlog and ADRs are up to date and reflect the current state of the project.
- Release 0.5.0 notes and backlog items updated to clarify TUI status and next steps.

## Cursor Rules Audit Report

- Cursor rules and ADR processes are effective and aligned with project needs.
- No conflicting or redundant rules identified.
- Rules support current development practices and quality standards.

## Proposed Updates - Release 0.5.0 Retrospective

### Process Improvements
#### Technical Prototyping
- **Current State**: Feature implementation sometimes begins before technical feasibility is fully validated.
- **Issue**: Risk of late discovery of architectural blockers.
- **Proposed Change**: Require technical prototyping for all high-risk features before full implementation.
- **Rationale**: Reduces wasted effort and clarifies feasibility early.
- **Impact**: Fewer blocked or deferred releases.

### Documentation Updates
#### Release Notes and Backlog
- **Current State**: Status of partial implementations not always clear.
- **Issue**: Users and contributors may be confused about feature availability.
- **Proposed Change**: Clearly document the status of partial/experimental features in release notes and backlog.
- **Rationale**: Improves transparency and planning.
- **Implementation**: Add explicit notes in release and backlog docs.

### Cursor Rules Updates
#### Retrospective and Prototyping Requirements
- **Current Rule**: Retrospectives and ADRs are required for major releases and architectural changes.
- **Issue**: Prototyping is not explicitly required for high-risk features.
- **Proposed Change**: Add a rule requiring technical prototyping for high-risk features before full implementation.
- **Rationale**: Ensures feasibility and reduces risk.
- **Implementation**: Update cursor rules to include this requirement.

### Technical Improvements
#### TUI Testing
- **Current State**: Automated TUI testing is not comprehensive.
- **Issue**: Risk of regressions and undetected bugs in TUI code.
- **Proposed Change**: Require automated test coverage for all TUI features using `teatest` and golden file tests.
- **Rationale**: Improves reliability and maintainability.
- **Implementation**: Add TUI test coverage as a release gate for future TUI work.

---

**Action Items:**
- Update documentation and backlog to clarify TUI status.
- Prioritize technical prototyping and automated TUI testing in next release.
- Review and update cursor rules to require prototyping for high-risk features.
- Communicate changes to all stakeholders.
