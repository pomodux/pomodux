# Backlog Item: Refactor Plugin Dialogs

## Summary
Refactor and modernize the plugin dialog system in Pomodux to improve user experience, maintainability, and integration with the new TUI architecture.

## Goals
- Standardize plugin dialog interactions across the application.
- Integrate plugin dialogs with the Bubbletea-based TUI for a consistent look and feel.
- Improve dialog usability, accessibility, and keyboard navigation.
- Simplify plugin dialog API for plugin developers.
- Ensure dialogs are testable and maintainable.

## Tasks
- [ ] Audit current plugin dialog implementations and identify inconsistencies or technical debt.
- [ ] Design a unified dialog interface/component for the TUI, using Bubbletea and Lipgloss.
- [ ] Refactor existing plugin dialogs to use the new interface/component.
- [ ] Update plugin API documentation to reflect dialog changes and best practices.
- [ ] Add automated tests for dialog interactions (using teatest where possible).
- [ ] Ensure accessibility and keyboard navigation are robust.
- [ ] Gather user/developer feedback on the new dialog system and iterate as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All plugin dialogs use the new standardized TUI interface/component.
- Dialogs are visually consistent, accessible, and support keyboard navigation.
- Plugin API documentation is updated and clear for developers.
- Automated tests cover dialog interactions and edge cases.
- User and developer feedback is positive or actionable improvements are identified.
