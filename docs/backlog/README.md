# Pomodux Backlog Organization

This folder contains **planning and requirements** for current and future Pomodux releases. These documents define what work needs to be done, user stories, acceptance criteria, and implementation approaches.

## Backlog Structure

### Current Release
- **No current release planned** - Features moved to future releases

### Planned Releases
- **No specific releases planned** - All features are in individual files below

### Individual Features

#### High Priority Features
- **[tui-terminal-interface.md](tui-terminal-interface.md)** - Terminal User Interface ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
  - *Note (Release 0.5.0 Audit):* Partial Bubbletea-based TUI implementation exists, but production-ready integration is deferred due to unresolved technical blockers (cross-process sync). Remains high priority for future releases.

#### Medium Priority Features

## 0.5.x: Comprehensive Test Review and Improvement
- Audit all existing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for relevance and coverage.
- Update and refactor tests to reflect new TUI-driven workflow and timer logic (including Bubbletea-based TUI).
- Add missing tests for TUI (using teatest), timer state transitions, plugin integration, and logging.
- Remove or rewrite outdated or brittle tests.
- Ensure all tests are runnable via `make test` and update documentation to describe the new test strategy.
- Improve test maintainability, clarity, and automation.

## Purpose and Context

These backlog documents serve as the **source of truth** for what needs to be built. They are used to:

1. **Create GitHub Issues**: Each backlog item can be converted to GitHub issues using the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. **Track Progress**: Monitor implementation status and completion
3. **Plan Releases**: Organize features into specific releases
4. **Guide Development**: Provide clear requirements and acceptance criteria

## Backlog Management

- **One Feature Per File**: Each feature has its own dedicated file for better organization
- **Priority Levels**: Features are categorized by priority (High, Medium, Low)
- **Component Organization**: Features are grouped by system component
- **Dependencies**: Clear dependency tracking between features

## Adding New Features

When adding new features to the backlog:

1. **Create Individual File**: Each feature should have its own `.md` file
2. **Follow Template**: Use the established format with Feature Status, User Story, Acceptance Criteria, etc.
3. **Update README**: Add the new feature to the appropriate section in this README
4. **Set Priority**: Assign High, Medium, or Low priority
5. **Specify Component**: Identify which system component the feature belongs to
