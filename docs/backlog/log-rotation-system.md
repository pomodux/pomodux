# Log Rotation System ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

> **Note**: This backlog item follows the 4-gate approval process. Issues can be created from this backlog using the GitHub issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Feature Status
- **Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Component**: Logging System
- **Dependencies**: Release 0.3.0 (Structured Logger)

## Feature Description

Implement automatic log file rotation to prevent log files from growing too large and consuming excessive disk space while maintaining timer accuracy and cross-platform compatibility.

## User Story

As a user, I want automatic log rotation so that log files don't consume excessive disk space while maintaining timer accuracy.

## Enhanced User Stories

- **As a user, I want configurable rotation settings** so that I can adapt to my storage constraints without affecting my timer experience.
- **As a user, I want rotation to work seamlessly across platforms** so that I have consistent behavior on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **As a user, I want to disable log rotation entirely** so that I can manage logs manually when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Automatic log file rotation based on size (configurable, default 10MB)
- [ ] Automatic log file rotation based on time (configurable, default daily)
- [ ] Configurable rotation settings (size, time, retention)
- [ ] Compressed archive of old log files (gzip compression)
- [ ] Retention policy for old log files (configurable, default 7 days)
- [ ] Graceful handling during rotation (atomic operations, no log loss)

### Non-functional requirements
- [ ] Non-blocking rotation operations
- [ ] Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- [ ] Platform-specific file locking implemented
- [ ] Cross-platform path handling using `path/filepath`
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing config files
- [ ] Configuration validation and error handling

### Plugin System Integration (ADR 004 Compliance)
- [ ] Plugins can access rotated log files
- [ ] Existing logging API remains unchanged
- [ ] Event logging consistency across rotations
- [ ] No performance impact on plugin operations


### Log Rotation Design
- **Size-based rotation**: Monitor log file size and rotate when threshold reached
- **Compression**: Compress old log files to save disk space (gzip)
- **Retention**: Implement retention policies to manage old log files
- **Atomic operations**: Ensure log rotation doesn't lose data
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking rotation to maintain timer accuracy

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk
- **Configuration Complexity**: Could violate ADR 005 simplicity requirements
  - **Mitigation**: Gradual configuration extension with clear defaults
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Could affect ADR 004 plugin system
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain API stability and comprehensive testing

## Implementation Notes

This feature builds upon the structured logger foundation implemented in Release 0.3.0. The current logging system provides a solid base for adding rotation capabilities. The recommended lumberjack approach ensures minimal changes to existing code while providing robust log rotation functionality.

The implementation should follow the established ADR compliance requirements and maintain backward compatibility with existing installations.

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Library Choice**: Lumberjack is the recommended solution based on industry standards and ADR alignment
2. **Integration Approach**: Lumberjack becomes the output writer for logrus, requiring minimal code changes
3. **Configuration Strategy**: Extend existing logging configuration with rotation settings
4. **Performance Focus**: Background processing and atomic operations to maintain timer accuracy
5. **Cross-Platform**: Platform-specific file locking and path handling for all target platforms

### Success Criteria

- **Timer Accuracy**: No measurable impact on timer precision (ADR 002 compliance)
- **User Experience**: Transparent operation with configurable behavior
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across Linux, macOS, and Windows (ADR 001 compliance)
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Existing plugins continue to work without modification (ADR 004 compliance)
- **Configuration**: Backward compatible with existing installations (ADR 005 compliance)
