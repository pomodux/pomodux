# Log Rotation System ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

> **Note**: This backlog item follows the 4-gate approval process. Issues can be created from this backlog using the GitHub issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Feature Status
- **Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Component**: Logging System
- **Dependencies**: Release 0.3.0 (Structured Logger)

## Feature Description

Implement automatic log file rotation to prevent log files from growing too large and consuming excessive disk space.

## User Story

As a user, I want automatic log rotation so that log files don't consume excessive disk space.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic log file rotation based on size (e.g., 10MB)
- [ ] Automatic log file rotation based on time (e.g., daily)
- [ ] Configurable rotation settings (size, time, retention)
- [ ] Compressed archive of old log files
- [ ] Retention policy for old log files (e.g., keep last 7 days)
- [ ] Graceful handling during rotation (no log loss)

## TDD Approach

- [ ] Test log rotation by size
- [ ] Test log rotation by time
- [ ] Test compression of old logs
- [ ] Test retention policy enforcement
- [ ] Test rotation during active logging
- [ ] Test configuration validation

## Technical Dependencies

- File system operations for log rotation
- Compression libraries for log archiving
- Configuration system for rotation settings

## Architecture Considerations

### Log Rotation Design
- **Size-based rotation**: Monitor log file size and rotate when threshold reached
- **Time-based rotation**: Rotate logs at specified intervals (daily, weekly)
- **Compression**: Compress old log files to save disk space
- **Retention**: Implement retention policies to manage old log files
- **Atomic operations**: Ensure log rotation doesn't lose data

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimal impact**: Log rotation should not impact timer performance
- **Background processing**: Rotation should happen in background
- **Resource usage**: Monitor disk I/O and CPU usage during rotation

## Implementation Notes

This feature builds upon the structured logger foundation implemented in Release 0.3.0. The current logging system provides a solid base for adding rotation capabilities.
