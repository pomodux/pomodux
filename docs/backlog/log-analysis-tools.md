# Log Analysis Tools ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

> **Note**: This backlog item follows the 4-gate approval process. Issues can be created from this backlog using the GitHub issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Feature Status
- **Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Component**: Logging System
- **Dependencies**: Release 0.3.0 (Structured Logger)

## Feature Description

Add tools for log analysis and reporting to help users understand their timer usage patterns and productivity trends.

## User Story

As a user, I want log analysis tools so that I can understand my timer usage patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Log parsing and analysis utilities
- [ ] Usage statistics and reporting
- [ ] Session pattern analysis
- [ ] Export functionality for log data

## TDD Approach

- [ ] Test log parsing utilities
- [ ] Test statistics calculation
- [ ] Test pattern analysis
- [ ] Test export functionality

## Technical Dependencies

- Log parsing and analysis libraries
- Data visualization capabilities
- Export functionality (JSON, CSV, etc.)

## Architecture Considerations

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Log parsing**: Parse structured log files (JSON/text format)
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify usage patterns and trends
- **Statistics generation**: Calculate productivity metrics
- **Data export**: Export analysis results in various formats

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient parsing**: Handle large log files without performance impact
- **Incremental analysis**: Support analysis of log files as they grow
- **Caching**: Cache analysis results for better performance

## Implementation Notes

This feature will leverage the structured logging foundation from Release 0.3.0. The existing log format (JSON/text) provides a good base for analysis tools.
