# Backlog Item: TUI Testing Refactoring and Best Practices

> **Update (Release 0.5.0 Audit):**
> Automated test coverage for the new Bubbletea-based TUI code in `internal/tui/` is required in the next release. All TUI features and state transitions must be covered by robust, automated tests.

## Summary
Refactor and expand the testing strategy for Bubbletea-based TUI components in Pomodux. Adopt best practices for automated, robust, and maintainable TUI tests using modern Go tools and frameworks.

## Goals
- Ensure comprehensive, automated test coverage for all TUI features and state transitions.
- Use `teatest` for end-to-end and golden file testing of Bubbletea programs.
- Improve maintainability and reliability of TUI tests.
- Integrate TUI tests into CI workflows.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add `teatest` as a test dependency in the project.
- [ ] Refactor existing TUI tests to use `teatest` for simulating keypresses, window resizes, and output assertions.
- [ ] Add golden file tests for key TUI output states to catch regressions.
- [ ] Write unit tests for Bubbletea model logic (Update/View methods) using standard Go testing.
- [ ] Ensure tests cover pause, resume, stop, quit, timer completion, and edge cases (e.g., rapid keypresses, window resizing).
- [ ] Integrate TUI tests into the CI pipeline.
- [ ] Document the TUI testing approach in developer documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All TUI features and state transitions are covered by automated tests.
- Tests use `teatest` for end-to-end and golden file testing.
- Model logic is unit tested for all key states and transitions.
- TUI tests run automatically in CI and pass reliably.
- Documentation is updated to describe the TUI testing strategy and usage of `teatest` and golden file tests.
