# TUI Testing Strategy for Pomodux

## Overview
This document summarizes best practices and frameworks for testing Bubbletea TUI applications in Go, with actionable recommendations for the Pomodux project.

---

## 1. teatest (Charmbraceletâ€™s Official Experimental Library)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest
- **Purpose:** End-to-end and golden file testing for Bubbletea programs.
- **Features:**
  - Simulate keypresses and window resizes.
  - Assert on final output, intermediate output, and final model state.
  - Golden file regression testing.
- **Example:**
  ```go
  import "github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest"

  func TestPauseResume(t *testing.T) {
      p := tea.NewProgram(NewModel(...))
      teatest.NewTestProgram(t, p).
          SendKey("p").
          SendKey("r").
          AssertModel(func(m tea.Model) {
              // Assert model state here
          })
  }
  ```
- **Status:** Experimental, but widely used in the Bubbletea community.

---

## 2. Standard Go Testing + Model Assertions
- Test Bubbletea model logic directly by calling `Update` and `View` with simulated messages.
- Assert on returned model state and output strings.
- **Example:**
  ```go
  func TestPause(t *testing.T) {
      m := NewModel(...)
      m, _ = m.Update(tea.KeyMsg{Type: tea.KeyRunes, Runes: []rune("p")})
      if !m.Paused {
          t.Error("expected model to be paused")
      }
  }
  ```

---

## 3. Golden File Testing
- Render TUI output with `View()`, save to a golden file, and compare in tests.
- Useful for catching regressions in UI layout and output.
- Can be used with `teatest` or standard Go file comparison utilities.

---

## 4. Integration with CI
- Add Bubbletea TUI tests to your CI pipeline.
- Use golden file tests to catch accidental UI regressions.

---

## 5. Other Community Tools
- **bubbles/testing:** Some Bubbletea component libraries provide their own test helpers.
- **Testcontainers:** For complex integration tests (e.g., plugins), use Docker-based test environments.

---

## Actionable Recommendations for Pomodux
1. Add `teatest` as a dev dependency for end-to-end TUI tests.
2. Write unit tests for your TUI model using standard Go testing.
3. Add at least one golden file test to catch UI regressions.
4. Simulate keypresses and window resizes in tests to cover pause, resume, stop, and quit flows.
5. Integrate TUI tests into your CI to ensure ongoing quality.

This strategy will guide the 0.5.x test review and future TUI development for Pomodux.
