> **Note**: This backlog item follows the 4-gate approval process. Issues can be created from this backlog using the GitHub issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Feature Status
- **Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Component**: Logging System
- **Dependencies**: Release 0.3.0 (Structured Logger)

## Feature Description

Enhance logging configuration options to provide more granular control over logging behavior and output.

## User Story

As a user, I want more logging configuration options so that I can customize logging behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Additional log levels (trace, fatal)
- [ ] Structured logging fields customization
- [ ] Log filtering and sampling options
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration

## TDD Approach

- [ ] Test additional log levels
- [ ] Test structured field customization
- [ ] Test filtering and sampling
- [ ] Test performance monitoring

## Technical Dependencies

- Enhanced logrus configuration
- Performance monitoring libraries
- Configuration system extensions

## Architecture Considerations

### Configuration Enhancements
- **Extended log levels**: Add trace and fatal levels for more granular control
- **Field customization**: Allow users to customize structured logging fields
- **Filtering options**: Implement log filtering based on various criteria
- **Sampling**: Support log sampling for high-volume scenarios

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimal overhead**: Ensure new configuration options don't impact performance
- **Efficient filtering**: Implement efficient log filtering mechanisms
- **Sampling strategies**: Optimize sampling for different use cases

## Implementation Notes

This feature extends the existing logging configuration system from Release 0.3.0. The current configuration structure provides a foundation for these enhancements.
