## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Known Issues

#### Timer State Persistence Test Interference
- **Issue Type**: Bug Report
- **Priority**: High
- **Component**: Timer Engine, Testing
- **Description**: Tests fail due to state persistence interference
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Run timer tests
  2. Some tests fail because they load previous state
- **Expected Behavior**: Tests should be isolated and not interfere with each other
- **Actual Behavior**: Tests load state from previous test runs
- **Proposed Solution**: Ensure state is cleared before each test

#### CLI Command Consistency
- **Issue Type**: Bug Report
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Component**: CLI
- **Description**: Some CLI commands use different patterns for state management
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Compare start.go and stop.go implementations
  2. Notice different approaches to timer management
- **Expected Behavior**: All commands should use consistent patterns
- **Actual Behavior**: Some commands use singleton manager, others create new timer
- **Proposed Solution**: Standardize on persistent state manager approach
