# Documentation Standards for Pomodux

> **Note:** This document establishes standards and guidelines for all Pomodux project documentation to ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability.

## 1.0 Documentation Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Clarity**: Documentation should be clear, concise, and easy to understand
- **Consistency**: Follow established formats and patterns across all documents
- **Completeness**: Include all necessary information without being verbose
- **Maintainability**: Structure documents for easy updates and maintenance
- **User-Centric**: Organize content for the intended audience

### 1.2 Documentation Types

| Type | Purpose | Audience | Location |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Process Documentation** | How to do things | Developers, Stakeholders | `docs/` |
| **Technical Documentation** | How things work | Developers, Architects | `docs/` |
| **Historical Records** | What was delivered | All stakeholders | `~/Documents/pomodux/releases/` |
| **Planning Documents** | What needs to be done | Stakeholders, Developers | `docs/requirements.md` |
| **Architecture Records** | Why decisions were made | Developers, Architects | `docs/adr/` |
| **Index Documentation** | Navigation and organization | All users | `docs/*/README.md` |

## 2.0 Document Structure Standards

### 2.1 Standard Document Header

```markdown
# Document Title

> **Note:** Brief description of the document's purpose and scope.

## 1.0 Section Title

### 1.1 Subsection Title

Content here...

### 1.2 Another Subsection

More content...

## 2.0 Another Section

Content here...
```

### 2.2 Required Elements

Every document should include:

1. **Clear Title**: Descriptive and specific
2. **Purpose Note**: Brief description of what the document covers
3. **Logical Structure**: Hierarchical organization with clear sections
4. **Cross-References**: Links to related documents
5. **Last Updated**: Date of last modification (for process documents)

### 2.3 Section Numbering

- Use hierarchical numbering: `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.1.1`
- Keep depth to 3 levels maximum
- Use descriptive section titles

## 3.0 Content Standards

### 3.1 Writing Style

- **Active Voice**: Use active voice when possible
- **Present Tense**: Use present tense for current information
- **Concise**: Be direct and avoid unnecessary words
- **Consistent**: Use consistent terminology throughout
- **Clear**: Avoid jargon unless necessary, then define it

### 3.2 Code Examples

```markdown
#### Example: Function Definition

```go
func ExampleFunction(param string) error {
    // Implementation here
    return nil
}
```

#### Usage Example

```bash
# Command line example
pomodux start 25m
```
```

### 3.3 Lists and Tables

#### Bullet Points
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.` for ordered lists
- Keep items concise and parallel in structure

#### Tables
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
```

### 3.4 Status Indicators

Use consistent status indicators:

- **‚úÖ COMPLETE** - Fully implemented and tested
- **üîÑ IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- **üìã PLANNED** - Planned for future development
- **‚ùå BLOCKED** - Blocked by dependencies or issues

## 4.0 File Organization Standards

### 4.1 File Naming Convention

- **Process Documents**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `release-management.md`)
- **Release Documents**: `release-X.Y.Z.md` (e.g., `release-0.3.0.md`)
- **ADR Documents**: `XXX-descriptive-name.md` (e.g., `001-programming-language-selection.md`)
- **Backlog Items**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `tui-terminal-interface.md`)
- **Index Documents**: `README.md` (in subdirectories)

### 4.2 Directory Structure

## 7.0 Index Documentation Standards

### 7.1 Purpose of Index READMEs

Index README files serve as **navigation hubs** for their respective directories, providing:

- **Directory Overview**: Clear explanation of the directory's purpose and contents
- **File Index**: Complete listing of all files with descriptions and status
- **Organization Structure**: How files are organized and categorized
- **Process Information**: Standards and conventions specific to the directory
- **Cross-References**: Links to related documentation and processes

### 7.2 When to Create Index READMEs

Create an index README when a directory contains:

- **5+ files** that benefit from organization and navigation
- **Different document types** that need explanation of relationships
- **Process-specific standards** that should be documented locally
- **Historical context** that helps users understand the collection
- **Complex organization** that benefits from visual structure

### 7.3 Index README Content Requirements

Every index README should include:

1. **Directory Purpose**: Clear explanation of what the directory contains
2. **File Index**: Complete listing of all files with:
   - File name and link
   - Brief description
   - Current status (if applicable)
   - Last updated date (if relevant)
3. **Organization Structure**: How files are categorized or organized
4. **Process Information**: Any standards or conventions specific to this directory
5. **Cross-References**: Links to related documentation and processes
6. **Maintenance Notes**: How to keep the index current

### 7.4 Index README Template

```markdown
# [Directory Name] Index

This directory contains [brief description of directory purpose].

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
