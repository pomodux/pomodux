# Release 0.5.0 - Responsive TUI Timer Screen

> **STATUS: NOT RELEASED**
> 
> The planned Bubbletea-based TUI feature for Pomodux was **not implemented** in this cycle. No code was built or merged for this feature, and the release is **deferred**. All planning, design, and documentation work remains as a reference for future implementation. The TUI feature remains in the backlog and will be re-planned for a future release. See below for the original release plan and acceptance criteria.
> 
> **Note (Audit):** Partial Bubbletea-based TUI code exists in `internal/tui/`, but was not merged or enabled for end users in this release. The feature is deferred due to unresolved technical blockers (cross-process synchronization).

## Overview

**Feature:** Responsive TUI Timer Screen
**Goal:** Deliver a visually rich, keyboard-driven timer interface that dynamically scales to any terminal size, using Bubbletea.

## TUI Mockup Example

Below is a mockup of the responsive TUI timer screen as envisioned for this release:

## Scope
- Implement a new TUI for timer sessions (work, break, long break) using Bubbletea
- The scope of this release is limited to updating the user interface; no changes to timer logic, session management, or business rules are included
- All existing functionality of the timer (session types, keyboard controls, realtime progress, logging, etc.) must be preserved
- Fully responsive layout (adapts to terminal width/height)
- **Assumption:** The timer TUI is a full window takeover and occupies the entire terminal window when active

## Release Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1: Design & Planning
- Review requirements, technical specs, backlog, and ADRs
- Confirm UI/UX design and acceptance criteria
- Select Bubbletea as the TUI framework
- **Audit all existing timer functionality and business rules to ensure the new TUI implementation preserves all controls, session types, and business logic. Document any findings or gaps before proceeding.**

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Scaffold `internal/tui/` package with Bubbletea
- Implement TimerView: session type, time remaining, progress bar, controls
- Integrate TUI launch into timer start command
- Implement responsive layout logic (handle resize events)
- Add graceful degradation for small terminals

### Phase 3: Testing
- Manual testing: all session types, all controls, resizing
- Automated tests: layout calculations, state transitions
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation checks

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Update or create `docs/tui-terminal-interface.md`
- Add usage instructions, screenshots, troubleshooting
- Update release notes and requirements if needed

### Phase 5: Release & Retrospective
- Prepare release notes and retrospective
- Complete retrospective per repo rules
- Update backlog and technical docs as needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Timer TUI launches on `pomodux start`
- [ ] UI displays session type, time remaining, progress bar, controls
- [ ] Layout adapts to terminal size (width and height)
- [ ] All controls work via keyboard
- [ ] Terminal state is restored on exit
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Manual and automated tests pass
- [ ] All existing timer features and behaviors are preserved

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                 | Mitigation                                    |
|-------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------|
| Terminal compatibility issues         | Use Bubbletea’s cross-platform abstractions   |
| Small terminal sizes                  | Show warning, require minimum size            |
| User confusion on controls            | Always display controls at bottom             |
| Regression in timer logic             | Automated/manual tests, code review           |

## Release Artifacts

- Source code: `internal/tui/`, CLI integration
- Documentation: `docs/tui-terminal-interface.md`, release notes
- Tests: new/updated for TUI and timer logic

## Testing Tasks

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests for TUI launch (ensure TUI starts on `pomodux start`)
- [ ] Add tests (where feasible) to simulate keypresses in the TUI and verify state transitions (pause, resume, stop, quit)
- [ ] Add tests for TUI output (e.g., using snapshot/golden file testing or output capture)
- [ ] Add tests for terminal resize events and verify UI adapts correctly
- [ ] Add tests for minimum terminal size handling (warning message)
- [ ] Add tests for spawning two timers simultaneously (verify correct error handling, process isolation, and user feedback)

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Visually inspect TUI for correct layout, session type, time remaining, progress bar, and controls
- [ ] Resize terminal window during timer session and verify UI adapts smoothly
- [ ] Use all keyboard controls ([P]ause, [R]esume, [S]top, [Q]uit, Ctrl+C) and verify correct behavior
- [ ] Check accessibility (screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Verify terminal state is restored on exit
- [ ] Manually attempt to start a second timer while one is running and verify correct error message or behavior

### Documentation
- [ ] Update manual UAT script to include TUI-specific test steps
- [ ] Document known limitations or manual steps for TUI testing if automation is not feasible

## Release Checklist

- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Release notes drafted
- [ ] Retrospective scheduled 

## Post-Release Notes

### Decision: TUI Library Standardization
- The team has decided to standardize on Bubbletea for all user-facing UI, including plugin dialogs and the main timer interface.
- This will ensure a consistent user experience and simplify maintenance.

### Next Steps: Planned 0.5.1 Release
- The 0.5.1 release will focus on migrating all plugin dialogs (currently implemented with tview) to Bubbletea.
- This includes notification modals, list selection dialogs, enhanced lists, and input prompts used by plugins.
- Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks for a robust, tested migration.
- Benefits: Unified look and feel, reduced dependencies, and easier future development. 

#### Code Status
- Partial Bubbletea-based TUI code exists in `internal/tui/`, but is not production-ready or enabled for end users. Further work is required to resolve cross-process synchronization and integration challenges.
