# Release 0.3.3 - Stop Command Enhancement

**Release Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Status:** ✅ Released  
**Type:** Bug Fix / Enhancement

## 🎯 Release Summary

This release adds a much-needed CLI stop command to allow users to stop running timers from the command line, addressing a significant usability gap in the previous versions.

## 🚀 New Features

### ⏹️ Stop Command
- **New CLI Command**: `pomodux stop`
- **Purpose**: Stop the currently running timer from the command line
- **Behavior**: 
  - Checks if a timer is running before attempting to stop
  - Records the session as interrupted in history
  - Triggers all plugin events (debug, Kimai integration, notifications, statistics)
  - Provides clear feedback when the timer is stopped

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Timer Control Enhancement
- **Issue**: No CLI command to stop running timers
- **Problem**: Users could only stop timers through interactive keypresses ('q'/'s') or signals (Ctrl+C)
- **Solution**: Added dedicated `stop` command for better user experience
- **Impact**: Improved usability and control over timer sessions

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### New Files
- `internal/cli/stop.go` - New stop command implementation

### Modified Files
- `cmd/pomodux/main.go` - Version updated to 0.3.3
- `internal/cli/version.go` - Version updated to 0.3.3

## 📋 Plugin System Integration

The stop command properly integrates with the plugin system:

### Debug Events Plugin
- Emits `timer_stopped` event with session details
- Logs: `🔴 DEBUG: timer_stopped - work session stopped after X seconds`

### Kimai Integration Plugin
- Stops Kimai timer if work session is interrupted
- Logs: `⏹️ Kimai timer stopped (work session interrupted)`

### Mako Notification Plugin
- Sends system notification: "Timer Stopped - Your timer session has been stopped."

### Statistics Plugin
- Increments `interrupted_sessions` counter
- Logs: "Statistics: Session interrupted"

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Start timer with `pomodux start 10s`
- ✅ Stop timer with `pomodux stop` from another terminal
- ✅ Verify timer status shows `Status: idle`
- ✅ Confirm plugin events are triggered correctly
- ✅ Test error handling when no timer is running

### Automated Testing
- ✅ All existing unit tests pass
- ✅ Plugin system tests pass
- ✅ CLI command structure tests pass

## 📦 Installation

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsmacapinlac/pomodux.git
cd pomodux
git checkout v0.3.3
make build
sudo cp bin/pomodux /usr/bin/pomodux
```

### From AUR (Arch Linux)
```bash
yay -S pomodux
# or
paru -S pomodux
```

## 🔄 Migration from 0.3.2

No migration steps required. This is a backward-compatible enhancement.

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Basic Stop Command
```bash
# Start a timer
pomodux start 25m

# Stop the timer from another terminal
pomodux stop
```

### Error Handling
```bash
# Try to stop when no timer is running
pomodux stop
# Output: Error: timer is not running (current status: idle)
```

### Integration with Other Commands
```bash
# Check status before stopping
pomodux status
pomodux stop

# View history after stopping
pomodux history
```

## 🎯 Impact

### User Experience
- **Before**: Users had to use interactive controls or signals to stop timers
- **After**: Users can stop timers from any terminal session
- **Benefit**: Improved usability and control over timer sessions

### Plugin Ecosystem
- **Before**: Stop events only triggered through interactive controls
- **After**: Stop events triggered through both interactive controls and CLI command
- **Benefit**: Consistent plugin behavior regardless of stop method

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Add confirmation prompt for stop command (optional flag)
- Add stop command for paused timers (currently only works for running timers)
- Add stop command with session type filtering

### Plugin Opportunities
- New plugins can now rely on CLI stop command availability
- Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities
- Better integration with external automation tools

## 📝 Release Notes
