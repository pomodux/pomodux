- Timer UI output remains user-friendly and unchanged.

### 4. Documentation & Migration
- Plugin development guide updated for new structure, cancellation, and TUI API patterns.
- Migration instructions: Move plugins to subfolders, ensure only `plugin.lua` is loaded, update any legacy plugin locations.
