# Programming Language Selection for Pomodux Terminal Timer Application

## 1. Context / Background

### 1.1 Current State
The Pomodux project is in the initial planning phase for a terminal-based timer/Pomodoro application. No programming language has been selected yet, and the team needs to establish the foundational technology stack.

### 1.2 Requirements
Based on the Pomodux project requirements, the selected language must support, in order of priority:

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Argument parsing, tab completion, and command routing
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support for Linux (Arch, Ubuntu), macOS (Homebrew), and potentially Windows
3. **Learning Curve & Onboarding**: Language should be learnable within reasonable timeframe for team members unfamiliar with it
4. **Terminal UI (TUI) Development**: Rich terminal interfaces with progress bars, keyboard input handling, and terminal resize events
5. **XDG/POSIX Compliance**: Proper configuration file handling and standards compliance
6. **Plugin System**: Lua runtime integration for extensibility
7. **Desktop Notifications**: System notification capabilities
8. **Package Distribution**: Easy packaging for Homebrew, Pacman, and APT
9. **Performance**: Fast startup times and minimal resource usage for a terminal application

## 2. Decision

**Selected Solution:** Go

### 2.1 Rationale
Given the updated priority order where CLI capabilities are the highest priority and learning curve is the third priority, Go provides the optimal balance of CLI excellence, cross-platform support, and gentle learning curve. It offers:

- **Exceptional CLI Framework**: `cobra` and `urfave/cli` are industry-leading CLI libraries with excellent tab completion, help generation, and command routing
- **Superior Cross-Platform Support**: Single binary compilation for all target platforms with minimal runtime dependencies
- **Gentle Learning Curve**: Simple syntax, clear conventions, and excellent documentation make Go accessible to developers unfamiliar with it
- **Rapid Development**: Simple syntax and fast compilation enable quick iteration on CLI features
- **Strong Standard Library**: Excellent built-in support for file operations, configuration handling, and system integration
- **Good TUI Support**: While not the primary focus, libraries like `bubbletea` provide solid TUI capabilities
- **Lua Integration**: `gopher-lua` provides adequate Lua runtime integration for the plugin system
- **XDG/POSIX Compliance**: Excellent system integration for configuration file handling
- **Package Distribution**: Single binary simplifies packaging across different package managers
