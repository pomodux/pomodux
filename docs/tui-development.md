# Terminal UI (TUI) Development Documentation

> **Status**: 📋 **BACKLOG** - Moved to separate documentation due to complexity  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
> **Reason for Backlog**: Cross-process synchronization complexity  

## Overview

The Terminal UI (TUI) feature was planned for Release 0.3.0 but was moved to the backlog due to the complexity of implementing cross-process timer synchronization between CLI and TUI instances.

## Feature Description

A rich terminal user interface built with Bubbletea that provides:
- Visual timer display with progress bars
- Interactive keyboard controls
- Theme system for customization
- Multiple views (timer, config, history, help)
- Real-time updates and notifications

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### Cross-Process Synchronization
The main challenge was synchronizing timer state between:
- **CLI Process**: Running persistent timer with keypress controls
- **TUI Process**: Separate process with visual interface

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **Global Timer Singleton**: Failed due to process isolation
2. **State File Synchronization**: Complex file I/O monitoring
3. **External State Monitoring**: Difficult to implement reliably

**Issues Identified:**
- Different timer instances per process
- State file reading/writing complexity
- Real-time synchronization challenges
- Debug complexity for troubleshooting

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Completed Work
- **TUI Framework**: Bubbletea integration with component-based architecture
- **Timer Display**: Progress bars, time remaining, session type display
- **Interactive Controls**: Keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- **Theme System**: Configurable colors and styles
- **View Components**: Config, history, and help views
- **State Management**: Timer state loading and application

### 🔄 Partially Implemented
- **Cross-Process Sync**: Basic state file monitoring (not working reliably)
- **External State Detection**: TUI monitoring of CLI state changes

### ❌ Not Implemented
- **Reliable Synchronization**: Working cross-process timer sync
- **Production-Ready TUI**: Clean, stable implementation

## Technical Design

### Component Structure
```
TUI App
├── Model (Main State)
├── Views
│   ├── TimerView (Main Timer Display)
│   ├── ConfigView (Configuration)
│   ├── HistoryView (Session History)
│   └── HelpView (Help & Shortcuts)
└── Theme System
```

### Key Components
- **App**: Main application with Bubbletea integration
- **Model**: Application state and view management
- **TimerView**: Real-time timer display with controls
- **Theme**: Configurable styling system

## User Experience Design

### Timer Display
- Large, clear time remaining display
- Visual progress bar with Unicode blocks
- Session type indicator (work, break, long-break)
- Status indicators (running, paused, completed, idle)

### Interactive Controls
- **Timer Controls**: p (pause), r (resume), s/q (stop)
- **Session Controls**: 1 (work), 2 (break), 3 (long-break)
- **Navigation**: c (config), h (history), ? (help), q (quit)
- **Universal**: Esc (back to timer)

### Theme System
- **Default Theme**: Clean, modern appearance
- **Dark Theme**: Low-light environment friendly
- **Light Theme**: High-contrast option
- **Custom Themes**: User-defined color schemes

## Future Implementation Considerations

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Single Process TUI**: Replace CLI with TUI-only interface
2. **IPC Communication**: Use inter-process communication (sockets, pipes)
3. **Shared Memory**: Implement shared memory for timer state
4. **Event System**: Real-time event broadcasting between processes

### Requirements for Reconsideration
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single-process or reliable IPC
- **Clear Use Case**: Strong user demand for TUI
- **Resource Availability**: Time for complex implementation
- **Technical Feasibility**: Proven cross-process sync solution

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons
1. **Cross-process synchronization is complex** and error-prone
2. **File-based state sharing** requires careful timing and error handling
3. **Real-time monitoring** adds significant complexity
4. **Debug output** becomes essential but overwhelming

### Process Lessons
1. **Complexity assessment** should happen earlier in planning
2. **Alternative approaches** should be considered before deep implementation
3. **User value** should be weighed against implementation complexity
4. **Backlog management** helps maintain project focus

## Current Status

The TUI feature is **moved to backlog** and will be reconsidered when:
- A simpler technical approach is identified
- There is clear user demand for TUI functionality
- Resources are available for complex implementation
- Cross-process synchronization can be solved reliably
