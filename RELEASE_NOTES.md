# Pomodux Release Notes

## Release 0.4.3 - Config Flag Fix and Path Expansion

**Release Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Version**: 0.4.3  
**Status**: ✅ **RELEASED**

---

## 🎉 What's New

Pomodux 0.4.3 addresses critical configuration management issues and improves path handling throughout the application. This release fixes the `--config` flag bug and resolves path expansion problems that were causing unwanted directory creation.

### ✨ Key Features

#### 🔧 Config Flag Fix
- **Issue Resolved**: The `--config` flag now properly respected by the plugin system
- **Architecture Improvement**: Implemented config injection pattern for consistent configuration usage
- **Impact**: Plugin system now correctly uses the specified configuration file

#### 🛠️ Path Expansion Improvements
- **Issue Resolved**: Tilde (`~`) in configuration paths is now properly expanded
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive path expansion for configuration paths
- **Impact**: Eliminates unwanted "~" folder creation in repository

#### 🧪 Enhanced Testing
- **New Tests**: Added path expansion validation tests
- **Coverage**: Improved test coverage for configuration management
- **Validation**: All CI/CD tests pass with 100% success rate

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using the Config Flag
```bash
# Load specific configuration file
bin/pomodux --config ~/.config/pomodux/config-test.yaml start 25m

# Plugin system now respects the config flag
bin/pomodux --config ~/.config/pomodux/config-test.yaml start 2s
```

### Configuration with Path Expansion
```yaml
plugins:
  directory: ~/.config/pomodux/plugins  # Will expand to /home/user/.config/pomodux/plugins
  enabled:
    kimai: true
```

---

## 📋 What's Fixed

### Bug Fixes
1. **Config Flag Bug**: `--config` flag loaded correct file but plugin system used default config
2. **Path Expansion Bug**: Literal "~" folder created in repository due to unexpanded tilde
3. **Plugin Configuration Access**: Plugins couldn't access actual configuration values

### What's Unchanged
- All existing CLI functionality
- Plugin system behavior
- Timer behavior and features
- Configuration validation rules

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- **New Path Expansion Tests**: All functionality verified
- **Config Injection Tests**: Config flag now works correctly

## Release 0.3.3 - Stop Command Enhancement

**Release Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Version**: 0.3.3  
**Status**: ✅ **RELEASED**

---

## 🎉 What's New

Pomodux 0.3.3 adds a much-needed CLI stop command to allow users to stop running timers from the command line, addressing a significant usability gap in the previous versions.

### ✨ Key Features

#### ⏹️ Stop Command
- **New CLI Command**: `pomodux stop`
- **Purpose**: Stop the currently running timer from the command line
- **Behavior**: 
  - Checks if a timer is running before attempting to stop
  - Records the session as interrupted in history
  - Triggers all plugin events (debug, Kimai integration, notifications, statistics)
  - Provides clear feedback when the timer is stopped

#### Plugin System Integration
- **Consistent Event Handling**: Stop events triggered through both interactive controls and CLI command
- **Plugin Compatibility**: All existing plugins work seamlessly with the new stop command
- **Enhanced Automation**: Better integration with external automation tools

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using the Stop Command
```bash
# Start a timer
pomodux start 25m

# Stop the timer from another terminal
pomodux stop

# Check status
pomodux status
```

### Error Handling
```bash
# Try to stop when no timer is running
pomodux stop
# Output: Error: timer is not running (current status: idle)
```

---

## 📋 What's Fixed

### Bug Fixes
1. **Missing CLI Stop Command**: Added `pomodux stop` command for better user experience
2. **Limited Timer Control**: Users can now stop timers from any terminal session
3. **Plugin Event Consistency**: Stop events now work through both interactive and CLI methods

### What's Unchanged
- All existing CLI functionality
- Interactive timer controls ('q'/'s' keypresses still work)
- Plugin system behavior
- Timer behavior and features

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
