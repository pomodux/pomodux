# Implementation Process

## Structured Implementation Approach
Follow the structured implementation pattern defined in [.claude/commands/plan-and-implement.md](mdc:.claude/commands/plan-and-implement.md)

This pattern includes:
1. **Requirements Clarification** - Understanding business needs
2. **Technical Analysis** - ADR review and codebase audit  
3. **Checklist Creation** - Breaking down tasks
4. **Implementation Planning** - Detailed execution plan
5. **Implementation Execution** - With approval gates
6. **Documentation Audit** - Final verification

## Key Integration Points
- Always review relevant ADRs during Technical Analysis phase
- Reference [docs/adr/](mdc:docs/adr/) for architectural decisions
- Follow established patterns in [docs/go-standards.md](mdc:docs/go-standards.md)
- **Important** Use approval gates to ensure alignment

## Process Benefits
- Ensures ADR compliance through structured analysis
- Provides clear approval gates
- Maintains documentation alignment
- Reduces implementation risks through planning
