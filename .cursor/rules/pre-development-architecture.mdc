# Pre-Development Architecture Review Rule

## Purpose
This rule ensures that all new features undergo proper architectural validation before development begins. It prevents development on features with fundamental architectural issues and maintains system integrity.

## Trigger Conditions
- New feature development planning
- Major architectural changes
- Integration of new components or technologies
- Multi-process or complex feature development

## Pre-Development Architecture Review Process

### 1. ADR Audit Phase

**Objective**: Review existing architectural decisions and identify constraints

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Review all existing ADRs** in `docs/adr/` for relevance and constraints
- [ ] **Identify architectural patterns** that must be followed
- [ ] **Check for conflicting decisions** that might impact the new feature
- [ ] **Document architectural constraints** that the new feature must respect

**ADR Audit Checklist**:
- [ ] Review ADR-001: Programming Language Selection
- [ ] Review ADR-002: Persistent Timer Design
- [ ] Review ADR-003: UAT Testing Approach
- [ ] Check for any other relevant ADRs
- [ ] Document any architectural conflicts or constraints

**Output**: ADR Audit Report with relevant constraints and patterns

### 2. Architecture Proposal Phase

**Objective**: Create comprehensive architecture proposal for the new feature

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Create architecture proposal** for the new feature
- [ ] **Define integration points** with existing components
- [ ] **Identify potential architectural impacts** on current system
- [ ] **Propose architectural patterns** to be used
- [ ] **Document any deviations** from established patterns with rationale

**Architecture Proposal Requirements**:
- Integration approach with existing timer engine
- File organization and package structure
- Testing strategy and approach
- Error handling patterns
- Performance considerations
- Security implications

**Output**: Detailed Architecture Proposal document

### 3. Architecture Review Phase

**Objective**: Validate architecture proposal and obtain approval

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Present architecture proposal** to stakeholders
- [ ] **Review against existing ADRs** and architectural constraints
- [ ] **Validate architectural assumptions** through proof-of-concept if needed
- [ ] **Obtain explicit approval** before development begins

**Review Criteria**:
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Integrates with existing components and patterns
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Follows established code organization and testing patterns
- [ ] **Scalability**: Supports future enhancements and growth
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
- [ ] **Security**: Maintains established security patterns

**Output**: Architecture Review Approval or rejection with feedback

### 4. Documentation Phase

**Objective**: Document architectural decisions and integration approach

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Create new ADR** if architectural decisions are made
- [ ] **Update relevant documentation** with architectural decisions
- [ ] **Document integration approach** and constraints
- [ ] **Update release planning** with architecture decisions

**Documentation Requirements**:
- New ADR if architectural decisions are made
- Updated technical specifications
- Integration documentation
- Updated release planning documents

## Architecture Review Criteria

### Compatibility Assessment
- [ ] **Existing Components**: New feature integrates with current architecture
- [ ] **Established Patterns**: Follows documented architectural patterns
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: No negative impact on existing functionality
- [ ] **Security Model**: Maintains established security patterns

### Maintainability Assessment
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Follows established file and package structure
- [ ] **Testing Approach**: Integrates with existing testing patterns
- [ ] **Documentation**: Maintains documentation standards
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Follows established error handling patterns

### Scalability Assessment
- [ ] **Future Growth**: Architecture supports future enhancements
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Efficient use of system resources
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Allows for future feature additions

## Integration with Release Management

### Gate 0: Architecture Review
- **Purpose**: Ensure architectural soundness before development begins
- **Deliverables**: ADR audit, architecture proposal, integration plan
- **Approval Criteria**: Architecture is sound, compatible, and approved
- **Process**: Must be completed before any development work begins

### Failure Criteria
**Development must NOT proceed if**:
- ADR audit reveals conflicting architectural decisions
- Architecture proposal doesn't address all constraints
- Integration approach is not validated
- Performance or security impacts are not mitigated
- Stakeholders do not approve the architectural approach

## Output Requirements

### Required Deliverables
1. **ADR Audit Report**: Summary of relevant ADRs and constraints
2. **Architecture Proposal**: Detailed architectural approach for the feature
3. **Integration Plan**: How the feature integrates with existing components
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential architectural risks and mitigation strategies
5. **Approval Documentation**: Explicit approval to proceed with development

### Documentation Standards
- All documents must follow established documentation standards
- Architecture proposals must be clear and comprehensive
- Integration plans must be detailed and testable
- Risk assessments must include mitigation strategies

## Continuous Improvement

### Post-Review Assessment
- Review architecture decisions for effectiveness after implementation
- Update ADRs based on lessons learned
- Refine architecture review process based on outcomes
- Document architectural patterns that worked well

### Process Refinement
- Update review criteria based on project experience
- Improve documentation templates and checklists
- Enhance integration with release management process
- Maintain lessons learned for future reviews

This pre-development architecture review ensures that all new features are architecturally sound before development begins, preventing costly rework and maintaining system integrity.
