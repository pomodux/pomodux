# Release Process Rules

## Core Release Process Principles

### Process-Driven Release Philosophy
- **Always work within a structured process**: All work (releases, features, bug fixes) must follow the defined process
- **Approval gates are mandatory**: No work can proceed without passing through the required approval gates
- **TDD is non-negotiable**: All code changes must follow Test-Driven Development process
- **Documentation-driven progress**: All progress must be tracked and documented
- **Quality gates are required**: Every change must meet quality standards before proceeding

## Primary Commands

### `Design a new feature`
**Purpose**: Plan and architect new features with proper validation

**Process**:
1. **ADR Audit Phase**
   - [ ] Review all existing ADRs in `docs/adr/` for relevance and constraints
   - [ ] Identify architectural patterns that must be followed
   - [ ] Check for conflicting decisions that might impact the new feature
   - [ ] Document architectural constraints that the new feature must respect

2. **Architecture Proposal Phase**
   - [ ] Create architecture proposal for the new feature
   - [ ] Identify any required third party libraries using architecture standards
   - [ ] Define integration points with existing components
   - [ ] Identify potential architectural impacts on current system
   - [ ] Propose architectural patterns to be used
   - [ ] Document any deviations from established patterns with rationale

3. **Feature Planning Phase**
   - [ ] Define work scope and requirements
   - [ ] Plan technical approach and implementation strategy
   - [ ] Define TDD approach and test strategy
   - [ ] Establish measurable success criteria
   - [ ] Create realistic timeline accounting for TDD and testing

**Required Deliverables**:
- ADR audit report
- Proposed ADR's 
- Stakeholder approval documentation

### `Organize a release`
**Purpose**: Plan and organize feature or features into a release 

**Process**:
1. **Release Planning Phase**
   - [ ] Confirm which features from the backlog `docs/backlog/` should be part of a release.

** If a feature is not documented in the backlog then do NOT proceed. **

2. **Documentation Organization**
   - [ ] Create/update release planning document in `docs/backlog/release-x.x.x.md`
   - [ ] Ensure documentation follows project management rules

3. **Gate 1 Preparation**
   - [ ] Prepare technical specifications
   - [ ] Plan TDD approach for all features
   - [ ] Identify risks and mitigation strategies
   - [ ] Obtain approval for release plan

**Required Deliverables**:
- Release planning document in backlog
- Technical specifications and TDD plans
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### `Implement a release`

   - Test should fail initially (Red phase)
   - Test should be specific and focused

2. **Write minimal code to pass (Green)**:
   - Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass
   - Don't add extra functionality yet
   - Focus on making the test green

3. **Refactor while keeping tests passing**:
   - Clean up the code while keeping tests passing
   - Improve design, readability, and performance
   - Ensure all tests still pass

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Overall Coverage**: Minimum 80% for all code
- **Critical Paths**: Minimum 95% for core functionality
- **Public APIs**: 100% coverage for all public interfaces
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and workflows

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Linting**: All code must pass project linting rules
- **Formatting**: All code must follow project formatting standards
- **Documentation**: All public functions must be documented
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and validation

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit test coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Validate user workflows
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure no regression in existing functionality
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Validate functionality across supported platforms

### Documentation Requirements
