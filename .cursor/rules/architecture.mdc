# Architecture Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Philosophy

- **Always audit the Decision Log folder**: Review existing ADRs (`docs/adr/*`) before making architectural changes. Only consider approved decisions.
- **Context preservation**: Understand historical decisions and their rationale before proposing changes
- **Consistency over novelty**: Prefer established patterns unless there's clear justification for deviation
- **Documentation-driven development**: Architectural decisions guide implementation, not the reverse
- **ADR's must contain the link to the website or GitHub repository**: All architectural decisions must include direct links to component documentation and source code for transparency and verification

### New Component Selection Criteria
- **Must be compatible with existing components**: New components must integrate seamlessly with current architecture and not break existing functionality
- **Must be actively maintained**: Components must have recent updates, active development, and community support

## Decision Documentation Guidelines

### Architectural Decisions vs Implementation Details

#### Decisions That Require ADR Documentation

**Architectural decisions** are strategic choices that affect the overall system design, have long-term implications, or establish patterns that guide future development. These **MUST** be documented as ADRs:

- **Technology Stack Choices**: Framework selection, programming language decisions, database choices
- **Architectural Patterns**: Design patterns, system organization, data flow approaches
- **Integration Strategies**: How systems communicate, API design decisions, external service integration
- **Performance Strategies**: Caching approaches, optimization methodologies, scalability decisions
- **Security Approaches**: Authentication methods, data protection strategies, privacy compliance
- **Development Process Changes**: CI/CD strategies, testing methodologies, deployment approaches
- **Breaking Changes**: Modifications that affect existing functionality or APIs
- **Component Selection**: Library and tool choices that become part of the core architecture

#### Implementation Details (No ADR Required)

**Implementation details** are tactical choices that follow established architectural patterns and don't establish new architectural direction. These are documented in implementation plans and technical specifications, **NOT** as ADRs:

- **Configuration Settings**: Specific component versions, build settings, environment variables
- **File Organization**: Directory structure, file naming conventions, asset organization
- **Code Implementation**: Specific function implementations, class structures, method names
- **UI/UX Details**: Specific styling choices, layout implementations, interaction patterns
- **Testing Implementation**: Specific test cases, testing frameworks setup, test data
- **Deployment Configuration**: Hosting setup, SSL configuration, domain management
- **Performance Optimization**: Specific caching rules, image optimization settings, minification

#### Decision Classification Framework

Use these questions to determine if a decision requires an ADR:

1. **Does this establish a new architectural pattern or approach?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

2. **Will this decision guide future development choices?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

3. **Does this choice have long-term maintenance implications?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

4. **Is this a strategic choice between multiple viable alternatives?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

5. **Does this decision affect the overall system architecture?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

## Process

### Documenting a Decision Log

#### ADR Creation Process
1. **Identify the decision**: Clearly state what architectural choice needs to be made
2. **Research existing ADRs**: Check `docs/Decision Log/` for related decisions
3. **Analyze alternatives**: Consider multiple approaches with pros/cons
4. **Document the decision**: Use the ADR template with full context and rationale
5. **Update status**: Mark as approved, pending, or deprecated as appropriate
6. **Communicate changes**: Ensure team awareness of new architectural decisions

#### ADR Review Process
- **Context validation**: Verify the decision aligns with project constraints and goals
- **Impact assessment**: Evaluate effects on existing systems and future flexibility
- **Implementation verification**: Cross-reference ADR decisions with actual code
- **Status updates**: Maintain current status of all ADRs as systems evolve

### Decision Auditing Workflow
1. **Pre-change audit**: Review relevant ADRs before implementing changes
2. **Dependency mapping**: Identify how decisions relate to and impact each other
3. **Consistency validation**: Ensure new changes align with established patterns
4. **Documentation updates**: Update ADRs when decisions become deprecated or superseded
