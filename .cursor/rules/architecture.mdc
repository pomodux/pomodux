# Architecture Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Philosophy

- **Always audit the Decision Log folder**: Review existing ADRs (`docs/adr/*`) before making architectural changes. Only consider approved decisions.
- **Context preservation**: Understand historical decisions and their rationale before proposing changes
- **Consistency over novelty**: Prefer established patterns unless there's clear justification for deviation
- **Documentation-driven development**: Architectural decisions guide implementation, not the reverse
- **ADR's must contain the link to the website or GitHub repository**: All architectural decisions must include direct links to component documentation and source code for transparency and verification

### New Component Selection Criteria
- **Must be compatible with existing components**: New components must integrate seamlessly with current architecture and not break existing functionality
- **Must be actively maintained**: Components must have recent updates, active development, and community support

## Pre-Development Architecture Review

### Mandatory Pre-Development Process

**Before any development begins on new features, the following architecture review process must be completed:**

#### 1. ADR Audit Phase
- [ ] **Review all existing ADRs** in `docs/adr/` for relevance and constraints
- [ ] **Identify architectural patterns** that must be followed
- [ ] **Check for conflicting decisions** that might impact the new feature
- [ ] **Document architectural constraints** that the new feature must respect

#### 2. Architecture Proposal Phase
- [ ] **Create architecture proposal** for the new feature
- [ ] **Define integration points** with existing components
- [ ] **Identify potential architectural impacts** on current system
- [ ] **Propose architectural patterns** to be used
- [ ] **Document any deviations** from established patterns with rationale

#### 3. Architecture Review Phase
- [ ] **Present architecture proposal** to stakeholders
- [ ] **Review against existing ADRs** and architectural constraints
- [ ] **Validate architectural assumptions** through proof-of-concept if needed
- [ ] **Obtain explicit approval** before development begins

#### 4. Documentation Phase
- [ ] **Create new ADR** if architectural decisions are made
- [ ] **Update relevant documentation** with architectural decisions
- [ ] **Document integration approach** and constraints

### Architecture Review Criteria

**The architecture review must validate:**

#### Compatibility
- [ ] **Existing Components**: New feature integrates with current architecture
- [ ] **Established Patterns**: Follows documented architectural patterns
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: No negative impact on existing functionality
- [ ] **Security Model**: Maintains established security patterns

#### Maintainability
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Follows established file and package structure
- [ ] **Testing Approach**: Integrates with existing testing patterns
- [ ] **Documentation**: Maintains documentation standards
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Follows established error handling patterns

#### Scalability
- [ ] **Future Growth**: Architecture supports future enhancements
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Efficient use of system resources
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Allows for future feature additions

### Architecture Review Output

**Required Deliverables:**
1. **ADR Audit Report**: Summary of relevant ADRs and constraints
2. **Architecture Proposal**: Detailed architectural approach for the feature
3. **Integration Plan**: How the feature integrates with existing components
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential architectural risks and mitigation strategies
5. **Approval Documentation**: Explicit approval to proceed with development

**Approval Criteria:**
- Architecture proposal is complete and well-documented
- All architectural constraints are addressed
- Integration approach is sound and tested
- Risks are identified and mitigated
- Stakeholders approve the architectural approach

### Integration with Release Management

**Pre-Development Architecture Review is integrated with the release management process:**

#### Gate 0: Architecture Review (New)
- **Purpose**: Ensure architectural soundness before development begins
- **Deliverables**: ADR audit, architecture proposal, integration plan
- **Approval Criteria**: Architecture is sound, compatible, and approved
- **Process**: Must be completed before any development work begins

#### Integration with Existing Gates
- **Gate 1**: Release Plan Approval - Architecture review results inform planning
- **Gate 2**: Development Completion - Architecture decisions guide implementation
- **Gate 3**: User Acceptance - Architecture supports user requirements
- **Gate 4**: Release Approval - Architecture decisions are validated

### Failure Criteria

**Development must NOT proceed if:**
- ADR audit reveals conflicting architectural decisions
- Architecture proposal doesn't address all constraints
- Integration approach is not validated
- Performance or security impacts are not mitigated
- Stakeholders do not approve the architectural approach

### Continuous Improvement

**After each release:**
- Review architecture decisions for effectiveness
- Update ADRs based on lessons learned
- Refine architecture review process based on outcomes
- Document architectural patterns that worked well

This pre-development architecture review ensures that all new features are architecturally sound before development begins, preventing costly rework and maintaining system integrity.

## Decision Documentation Guidelines

### Architectural Decisions vs Implementation Details

#### Decisions That Require ADR Documentation

**Architectural decisions** are strategic choices that affect the overall system design, have long-term implications, or establish patterns that guide future development. These **MUST** be documented as ADRs:

- **Technology Stack Choices**: Framework selection, programming language decisions, database choices
- **Architectural Patterns**: Design patterns, system organization, data flow approaches
- **Integration Strategies**: How systems communicate, API design decisions, external service integration
- **Performance Strategies**: Caching approaches, optimization methodologies, scalability decisions
- **Security Approaches**: Authentication methods, data protection strategies, privacy compliance
- **Development Process Changes**: CI/CD strategies, testing methodologies, deployment approaches
- **Breaking Changes**: Modifications that affect existing functionality or APIs
- **Component Selection**: Library and tool choices that become part of the core architecture

#### Implementation Details (No ADR Required)

**Implementation details** are tactical choices that follow established architectural patterns and don't establish new architectural direction. These are documented in implementation plans and technical specifications, **NOT** as ADRs:

- **Configuration Settings**: Specific component versions, build settings, environment variables
- **File Organization**: Directory structure, file naming conventions, asset organization
- **Code Implementation**: Specific function implementations, class structures, method names
- **UI/UX Details**: Specific styling choices, layout implementations, interaction patterns
- **Testing Implementation**: Specific test cases, testing frameworks setup, test data
- **Deployment Configuration**: Hosting setup, SSL configuration, domain management
- **Performance Optimization**: Specific caching rules, image optimization settings, minification

#### Decision Classification Framework

Use these questions to determine if a decision requires an ADR:

1. **Does this establish a new architectural pattern or approach?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

2. **Will this decision guide future development choices?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

3. **Does this choice have long-term maintenance implications?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

4. **Is this a strategic choice between multiple viable alternatives?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

5. **Does this decision affect the overall system architecture?**
   - **Yes** → ADR required
   - **No** → Implementation detail

## Process

### Documenting a Decision Log

#### ADR Creation Process
1. **Identify the decision**: Clearly state what architectural choice needs to be made
2. **Research existing ADRs**: Check `docs/Decision Log/` for related decisions
3. **Analyze alternatives**: Consider multiple approaches with pros/cons
4. **Document the decision**: Use the ADR template with full context and rationale
5. **Update status**: Mark as approved, pending, or deprecated as appropriate
6. **Communicate changes**: Ensure team awareness of new architectural decisions

#### ADR Review Process
- **Context validation**: Verify the decision aligns with project constraints and goals
- **Impact assessment**: Evaluate effects on existing systems and future flexibility
- **Implementation verification**: Cross-reference ADR decisions with actual code
- **Status updates**: Maintain current status of all ADRs as systems evolve

### Decision Auditing Workflow
1. **Pre-change audit**: Review relevant ADRs before implementing changes
2. **Dependency mapping**: Identify how decisions relate to and impact each other
3. **Consistency validation**: Ensure new changes align with established patterns
4. **Documentation updates**: Update ADRs when decisions become deprecated or superseded
